## Installation

Type "npm install" in the console to install the dependancies this application requires (Inquirer, MySQL2, and console.table package). 

## Usage

In order to run this program, the user must type "node index.js" in their console. The program will only work if they have a running sql database with the schema used in the db folder, otherwise the program will not know what you're talking about, since it relies on a connection to the employees_db database provided.
